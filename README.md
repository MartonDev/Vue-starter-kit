# vue-cli-starter-kit
This is a basic starter kit for Vue cli apps, that I use in my projects. It has `vue-router`, `vuex` and `sass-loader` preinstalled

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
